# Priority Queue Based Task Scheduling System

---

## Description

This project implements a **Priority Queue–based Task Scheduling System** as part of academic coursework. The main objective is to demonstrate how tasks are scheduled and executed based on priority using fundamental **Data Structures** concepts.

The system provides a **menu-driven interface** where users can add tasks, pause execution, resume processing, and reset the scheduler. Higher-priority tasks are always executed before lower-priority tasks.


---

## Objectives

* To understand and implement the **Priority Queue** data structure
* To simulate **task scheduling** concepts used in Operating Systems
* To design a simple **menu-driven program**
* To strengthen problem-solving using data structures

## Installation

Steps to run the project locally:

bash\n
*Clone the repository

* Navigate to the project folder




Make sure **Python 3.x** is installed.

---

## Usage

Execute the program using:

```bash
python Project.py
```

The program displays a menu for task scheduling operations.

---

## Menu Options

* **A – Add New Task**
  Adds a task with a specified priority to the priority queue.

* **Space – Pause Execution**
  Temporarily pauses task execution.

* **Resume – Resume Execution**
  Continues execution after pause.

* **R – Reset Scheduler**
  Clears all tasks and resets the queue.

## Sample Output

```
----- Task Scheduler Menu -----
A - Add New Task
Space - Pause Execution
Resume - Resume Execution
R - Reset Scheduler

Enter your choice: A
Enter task name: Task1
Enter priority: 1
Task added successfully
```
